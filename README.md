# Censor-Dodge Proxy Gen

Recently i have made a Censor-Dodge Proxy Gen with some guidance from Hidden#2907 (Read more info on him here: https://pastebin.com/kkytJ1KW). This program is guaranteed to help you unblock any website on any network without any struggles, just type in the subdomain, amount of proxies to make and proxies will be made written onto a proxies.txt file!

## Getting Started

1. You will now need to download the latest release/source code as a .zip
2. Unzip that mf
3. Run that sht
4. Enter subdomain eg "fortnitemen92ismypassword", you stupid mf need a reminder not to use special characters or spaces
5. Proxies will be generating as you sit on your goofy office chair
